[**Read the Documentation**](https://nouman64-cat.github.io/react-voice-action-router/)

A headless, latency-first voice intent router for React applications. It bridges natural language speech to your existing React functions using an LLM-Agnostic Adapter Pattern.

- **Headless & Zero UI:** We provide the logic hooks; you build the interface (or keep it invisible).
- **Context-Aware:** The AI only knows about commands on the current screen, reducing costs and hallucinations.
- **Universal Adapter:** Built-in support for OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and local Ollama models.
- **Latency-First:** Supports instant execution for exact phrases, falling back to AI for fuzzy intents.

```bash
npm install react-voice-action-router
