features:
  - title: Built-in Speech Engine (v2.0)
    details: No more boilerplate. We handle the browser's SpeechRecognition API, including auto-restarts, error handling, and cross-browser support.
  - title: Dictation Mode (v2.0)
    details: Seamlessly switch between "Command Mode" and "Typewriter Mode". Capture raw text input with a single function call.
  - title: Offline Fallback (v2.0)
    details: Your app keeps working even if the internet goes down. We automatically fall back to local keyword matching if the AI is unreachable.
  - title: Context-Aware Commands
    details: The AI only knows about commands registered on the current screen. This reduces API costs and prevents hallucinations.
  - title: Universal AI Adapter
    details: Built-in support for OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude. Easily create custom adapters for any AI provider.
