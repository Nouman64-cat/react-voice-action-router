features:
  - title: Headless and Zero UI
    details: We provide the logic hooks and you build the interface. Keep your voice controls invisible or design a custom experience. No forced UI components.
  - title: Context-Aware Commands
    details: The AI only knows about commands registered on the current screen. This reduces API costs and prevents hallucinations from unrelated commands.
  - title: Universal AI Adapter
    details: Built-in support for OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude. Easily create custom adapters for any AI provider or local models.
  - title: Latency-First Design
    details: Supports instant execution for exact phrase matches with zero latency. Falls back to AI only when fuzzy matching is needed.
